Join us on Slack: ROSbloX Workspace Follow us on Twitter: ROSbloX (@xploros) Subscribe to our Youtube channel: ROSbloX About ROSbloX The Robot Operating System (ROS), https://www.ros.org/ , is rapidly becoming a de facto standard for writing interoperable and reusable robot software. The interoperability and reusability of ROS software come at the price of an increased sofware complexity. Getting started with ROS is complex, especially for developers with backgrounds other than sofware engineering. ROSbloX are modules to explore the functionality of various sensors and actuators and to discover the capabilities of ROS with minimal prior knowledge. Each ROSbloX implements a sensor or an actuator, is equipped with multiple communication interfaces to connect to computers and simple user interfaces, namely a web interface, a python library, and native ROS, to transmit data. Requirements ROSbloX function with computers which run Windows, MacOS or Linux. Note, ROSbloX do not require any installation of ROS on a computer. Connecting to ROSbloX ROSbloX can be connected via USB-C or Ethernet. Connecting to ROSbloX via USB The USB port of ROSbloX is configured such that the ROSbloX appears on your computer as a network adapter. When connected via USB, the ROSBloX is accessible via the static IP address, [10.99.10.99/24]. The ROSbloX runs a DHCP server on the USB interface and automatically assigns an IP address to your computer. Connecting to ROSbloX via Ethernet Each ROSbloX's Ethernet interface has two IP addresses assigned to it. One static which is set on the ROSbloX itself and one dynamic which waits for a DHCP lease. Dynamic IP Adress from a DHCP Server The dynamic IP address of a ROSbloX is assigned to it by a DHCP server. To access a ROSbloX via its dynamic IP address, the IP address is found on the DHCP server. Static IP Adress Each ROSbloX ships with the same static IP address, [10.99.11.99/24]. To access a ROSbloX via their static IP address, ensure the computer's connected Ethernet interface has a static IP address in the same subnet. Note, this can lead to conflicts if you connect multiple ROSbloX to the same network. See Changing a ROSbloX network configuration , for instructions how to change a ROSbloX network configuration. Interfacing with ROSbloX Three interfaces are available to transmit data to/from ROSbloX. First, a simple web interface can be used to visualize and/or download data from a ROSbloX. Second, the Python library, roslibpy, which enables data transmission to/from ROSbloX without installing ROS and is easy to integrate in Python scripts. And third, each ROSbloX can be found as ROS node by other ROS nodes in a network. Some networks do not allow the discovery of ROSbloX by their mDNS name, i.e. ROSbloX cannot be reached at [rockpis.local]. In that case their interfaces can be accessed by their IP address's, i.e. [10.99.10.99] if connected via USB and [10.99.12.99] if connected Ethernet. Web Interface To open a ROSbloX's web interface, a computer requires solely the Chrome browser to be installed. After a ROSbloX has started (which can take up to a minute), its web interface is accessible at [http://rockpis.local] in your Chrome browser. roslibpy To transmit data to/from a ROSblox in a Python script, the roslibpy can be used. Install the library with pip install roslibpy. ROS Each ROSbloX can be accessed as normal ROS node, e.g. it shows up when executing ros2 topic list. We refer to the official ROS documentation how to communicate with ROS nodes in a network. Further resources and tutorials how to get started with ROS are xxx. Open Architecture ROSblox are open. Login to a ROSbloX via SSH. Username: rock Password: rock Changing a ROSbloX network configuration The ROSbloX network interfaces are configured in /etc/netplan/01-net.cfg. We refer to netplan.io for further instructions how to modify its network configuration.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#the-rosblox-documentation","text":"ROSbloX are modules to discover the Robot Operating System (ROS).
