### About ROSbloX

The Robot Operating System (ROS), [https://www.ros.org/](https://www.ros.org/), is rapidly becoming a de facto standard for writing interoperable and reusable robot software. The interoperability and reusability of ROS software come at the price of an increased software complexity. Getting started with ROS is complex, especially for developers with no backgrounds in software engineering.  

ROSbloX are building blocks that simplify the creation of a robot's software stack. They are designed based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) and comply with modern software engineering standards. With ROSbloX, users can easily develop, maintain, and scale their robot's software stack, even without prior software engineering experience. Each ROSbloX implements a sensor, actuator or algorithm, is equipped with multiple communication interfaces to connect to it and simple user interfaces, namely a web interface, a python library, and native ROS, to transmit data.  


### Available ROSbloX

The available ROSbloX are continuously expanded. Contact us to propose novel ROSbloX and to obtain existing ROSbloX!
