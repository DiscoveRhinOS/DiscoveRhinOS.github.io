### About ROSbloX

The Robot Operating System (ROS), [https://www.ros.org/](https://www.ros.org/), is rapidly becoming a de facto standard for writing interoperable and reusable robot software. The interoperability and reusability of ROS software come at the price of an increased sofware complexity. Getting started with ROS is complex, especially for developers with backgrounds other than sofware engineering.  

ROSbloX are modules to explore the functionality of various sensors and actuators and to discover the capabilities of ROS with minimal prior knowledge. Each ROSbloX implements a sensor or an actuator, is equipped with multiple communication interfaces to connect to computers and simple user interfaces, namely a web interface, a python library, and native ROS, to transmit data.  

The ROSbloX project has just started. We greatly appreciate your inputs through our amazing [ROsbloX Feedback](https://forms.gle/vUeeocDE7jSQKdCc7) form to further develop the project.
